# cnn-image-classifier
convolutional neural networks for image classification in PyTorch: write pieces of code for training/testing routine, train a simple baseline network, design your own architecture and pick parameters to beat the baseline, fine-tune a pre-trained deep neural net, and create a simple region proposal net.
